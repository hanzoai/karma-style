/**
 * A knob is CSS's, so the TS table publishes the VALUE and leaves the knob behind.
 *
 * `--text-xs` and `--space-1` are authored as `calc(0.6875rem * var(--type-scale, 1))`
 * so one property retunes the whole ramp at runtime. That is right in a stylesheet
 * and unusable in JavaScript twice over: nothing in JS can resolve a `var()`, so a
 * consumer computing with the value gets NaN, and a consumer writing it into an
 * inline style outranks every stylesheet — which is the one thing this package
 * spends its whole cascade avoiding.
 *
 * So the two facts braided into that one string are separated here. The value is
 * the ramp; the knob is the cascade's, and `styles.css` is generated straight from
 * the CSS, so it keeps the calc and the runtime knob still works. `cssVar()`'s
 * fallback gets the literal too, which is what a host with no token layer mounted
 * actually wants — there is no `--type-scale` there either.
 *
 * The shape is exact (`calc(<value> * var(--<knob>, 1))`) and only that shape is
 * unwrapped; a genuinely composite calc (`calc(var(--fold) - 1px)`) is untouched.
 * check-tokens.mjs holds it: no emitted value may name a knob.
 *
 * The type ramp adds a second knob INSIDE the first — a rung is
 * `calc((<anchor> ± <delta> * var(--type-ratio, 1)) * var(--type-scale, 1))`, and
 * the small rungs wrap that in a `max()` floor. Both are peeled here, in the
 * order they nest, and the arithmetic is then done at the published defaults
 * (both knobs 1) so the table carries exactly the rung the sheet renders — which
 * is the same number it carried before the ratio existed. The floor is DROPPED
 * rather than evaluated: it exists to catch a person's settings compounding, and
 * at the defaults it never binds, so keeping it would put a guard in the table
 * against a knob the table does not have.
